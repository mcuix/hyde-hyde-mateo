# Hyde-hyde-mateo

__`Hyde-hyde-mateo`__ is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme inspired and derived from @htr3n's [Hyde-hyde](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde) theme. I began tweaking it to the point where I thought my own version would be easier to work with, and share.

Working example: https://www.mattmayes.com

Current changes are related to colors, layout, and performance.
